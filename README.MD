Course Project 
==================================================================
## Description

This file, titled 'README,' is intended to be read by users interested in running or evaluating the Course Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera in this GitHub repository.

Please note that the dataset on which this project is based is cited at the bottom of this file as footnote [1].

## Contents of Repository

- `README.md`: This file, which describes the other files in the repository.

- `CodeBook.md`: A file that summarizes the variables and data fields involved in the Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data, as well as the transformations and work performed to clean up the data.

- `run_analysis.R`: A file that contains the script that accomplishes the following tasks, in fulfillment of the course project requirements for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.*

*Please note that this file assumes that the dataset exists in the working directory, in its unzipped format, and that all files within the unzipped folder remain in their original locations.  

- `tidyWearableData.R`: A file that is created upon running 'run_analysis.R', provided that the dataset exists in the working directory, in its unzipped format, and that all files within the unzipped folder remain in their original locations. It contains a tidy dataset that contains the mean value of each variable for each subject and activity pair, which is based on the wearable technology dataset cited in footnote [1].
